## Overview

During June 2024, I conducted extensive qualitative fieldwork in Cross River State, Nigeria, focusing on understanding the dynamics of female genital mutilation and sexual behavior patterns in local communities.

## Objectives

- Conduct in-depth interviews with community members
- Understand local perceptions of FGM
- Assess the impact of recent policy interventions
- Document cultural narratives surrounding the practice

## Key Activities

- **Interviews:** 45 semi-structured interviews with women, community leaders, and healthcare providers
- **Focus Groups:** 6 focus group discussions in urban and rural settings
- **Community Mapping:** Identified key stakeholders and community structures
- **Policy Analysis:** Reviewed local implementation of anti-FGM legislation

## Outcomes

This fieldwork provided crucial insights into the persistence mechanisms of FGM and identified potential intervention points for future policy design. The data collected forms a central component of my dissertation research.

## Funding
