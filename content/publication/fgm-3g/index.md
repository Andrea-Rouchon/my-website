abstract: >
  Harmful norms persist because they fulfill a socially valued function. In many Nigerian communities, female genital mutilation (FGM) is practiced because it is believed to discourage premarital and extra-marital sex. This paper examines the impact of the expansion of fast internet on FGM in Nigeria. Our findings indicate that exposure to fast internet reduces both the prevalence of FGM and support for it. The effect does not appear to be driven by exposure to explicit anti-FGM content online. Instead, we find that the effect of fast internet on FGM is driven by fast internet reducing premarital sex stigma, thereby diminishing the value of the social function FGM serves. These findings provide evidence on how harmful norms evolve as the value of their social function changes, with implications for designing effective interventions.
